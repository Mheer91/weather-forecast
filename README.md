5 day weather forecast

In this project we had to make a weather dashboard. It shows a 7 day forecast, including today. It also changes the color of the UV index section based on the severity of the uv index. I followed the EPA's guide to uv index for coloring: https://www.epa.gov/sunsafety/uv-index-scale-0. It also has a search history that you can use to visit previous searches.
